# Giphy API key creation
Continuum has to use a BYOK(Bring your own key) model. Continuum is open source, and [Giphy](https://giphy.com/)(now owned by [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/)) charges crazy money for apps to use their API. This is very akin to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) API costs, but much worse.

## Instructions
1. Go [here](https://developers.giphy.com/)
2. Click the `Create Account` button
